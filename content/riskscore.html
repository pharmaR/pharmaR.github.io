title: "The {riskscore} Package"
---



<p>A data package for cataloging riskmetric results across public repositories.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Right now, the <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskscore"><code>{riskscore}</code></a> is in a PoC stage that is not fully operational. With that said, there are several use cases that make the concept of {riskscore} valuable, including (but not limited to) the following: it …</p>
<ul>
<li>Guides more effective discussion around how to summarize risk</li>
<li>Helps communicate changes to <code>{riskmetric}</code>’s summarizing algorithm or interpretations of assessment data</li>
<li>Aids the <code>{riskmetric}</code> dev team in identifying “edge cases” for analysis and code refinement.</li>
<li>Provides a channel to distribute handy tools for building <code>{riskmetric}</code> result data (ie, mimicking how our process for external packages could serve as a useful template for when comparing to internal or private repos).</li>
<li>Allows everyone to report risk scores in terms of a “CRAN percentile” instead of just some arbitrary numeric value.</li>
<li>Establishes a central repository for package scores, which can be used for many applications, like generating badge scores or trending in a package’s score over time to measure performance.</li>
</ul>
