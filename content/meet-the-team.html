<h2>Team Structure</h2>
<p>The R Validation Hub is an R Consortium Working Group. The R Consortium supports several related working groups, and these working groups have a similar overall objective: to support the use of R within the biopharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, the working groups are complementary; each has its own distinct deliverables and many of the R Validation Hubâ€™s members are also members of the other working groups.</p>
