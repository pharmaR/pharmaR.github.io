<h2>Team Structure</h2>
<p>The R Validation Hub is an R Consortium Working Group. The R Consortium supports several related working groups, and these working groups have a similar overall objective: to support the use of R within the biopharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, the working groups are complementary; each has its own distinct deliverables and many of the R Validation Hub’s members are also members of the other working groups.</p>
<p>Within the R Validation Hub, we have many workstreams that focus on their own respective activities. Find each workstream’s duties below as well as the members that support them.</p>

<h3>Strategic Workstream</h3>
<p>The <strong>Strategic Workstream</strong> has the responsibility of aligning on longer-term strategic goals. The intention is that this workstream is to become a floating set of representatives from each of our workstreams.</p>

<h3>Communications Workstream</h3>
<p>The <strong>Communications Workstream</strong> focuses on how we build connections across the R world, specifically with our neighboring initiatives: the R Consortium, PhUSE, PSI AIMS, the R Submissions Working Group, and ROpenSci. This working group also supports the effort to make the R Validation Hub more intentional with how we organize ourselves and look into best means to disseminate information.</p>
