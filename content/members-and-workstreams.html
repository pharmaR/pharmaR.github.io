<h3>Strategic Workstream</h3>

<div id="communications-workstream" class="section level3">
<h3>Communications Workstream</h3>
<p>The <strong>Communications Workstream</strong> focuses on how we build connections across the R world, specifically with our neighboring initiatives: the R Consortium, PhUSE, PSI AIMS, the R Submissions Working Group, and ROpenSci. This working group also supports the effort to make the R Validation Hub more intentional with how we organize ourselves and look into best means to disseminate information.</p>
