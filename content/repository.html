<h1>
An Open-Source Regulatory R Package Repository
</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">
A first-in-the-industry open-source approach to regulatory quality
</h2>

<p>
Every regulatory submission requires evidence that the software used meets
quality standards appropriate for the type of work. The
<strong><i>R Validation Hub</i></strong>
proposed standards for this process in our
<a href="/white-paper">2020 White Paper</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now we're translating those standards into an open-source repository of
risk assessments, available to all. We hope to empower validation that is
<strong>consistent</strong>, <strong>reproducible</strong> and
<strong>transparent</strong>, lowering the barrier to entry for start-ups,
empowering consistency among contract research organizations (CROs), and
improving the speed of regulatory review for established enterprises.
