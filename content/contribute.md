# Join the R Validation Hub

## Get on the Mailing List

For occasional news updates, you can join our [mailing list](https://lists.r-
consortium.org/g/RConsortium-Validation-Hub). This will enable you and your
colleagues to receive notifications of key updates/software releases, blog posts
and **invites to all-hands Hub meetings**.

Once you've joined, you can [subscribe to your calendar](https://lists.r-
consortium.org/calendar) to keep tabs on all R Validation Hub all-hands
meetings.

## Leadership Sponsors

In an effort to have a longer, more intentional direction for the team, we'd
like to invite 3-5 leaders throughout the industry to serve as sponsors. This
role would have minimal overhead - anticipating approximately 4 meetings a year
- which will be used to gather feedback from more senior leaders to ensure that
we're heading in direction that is serving the industry's needs.

If you're interested or have a senior leader in your organization in mind,
please put us in contact by emailing our 
[mailing list owner](RConsortium-Validation-Hub+owner@lists.r-consortium.org).

## Contribute to a Working Group

If you are willing and able to commit more time to the R Validation Hub's
mission, then there are several options depending on your skills and interests.
If you do not feel you have the necessary technical skills to contribute then
please don't let that stop you getting in touch and sharing ideas to support the
implementation of a risk-based R package assessment.

In each case you can get involed either by contacting the stream leads via the
relevant GitHub page, or by sending a message to us via the contact form on our
[Contact Us](/contact/) page.

### Communications Workstream

We're proud to formalize a lot of our event organizing under the new
communications workstream, which will focus on a more streamlined and consistent
approach to knowledge sharing and our various mediums of communications. We're
looking for two new contributors, preferrably with an enthusiasm for social
media, outreach, organizing and clear communication.

If you tick any of those boxes, please email our 
[mailing list owner](RConsortium-Validation-Hub+owner@lists.r-consortium.org)
and we'll put you in contact with the team.

### The [{riskmetric}](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric) R Package

The {riskmetric} package collects metrics that support the idea of a risk-based
evaluation of R packages. The package collects and summarises various metrics
and provides the means to quantify the risk of a package via a weighted risk
score. It also serves as the backbone to the Risk Assessment shiny application.
For more information see the [package site](https://pharmar.github.io/
riskmetric/) or [GitHub page](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric).

**Current Focus**

The {riskmetric} team are currently looking to build features to support
the idea of package cohorts. We are also looking to refine some of the meta-
information collected by riskmetric to better-serve the risk assessment
application. The team also have a [backlog of other open issues](https://
github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues), including additional metrics that they
would like to explore.

**Key Skills Required**

A fundamental understanding of R packages is essential for anyone looking to
support the {riskmetric} team. Package development experience is also highly
beneficial.

### The [Risk Assessment Application](https://github.com/pharmaR/risk_assessment)

The risk assessment shiny app is an extension of the {riskmetric} R package and
provides a graphical interface to the {riskmetric} functionality.  It provides
further exploratory capabilities in addition to the numeric metrics and improves
ease-of-use for non-technical users. For more information see the [package
GitHub page](https://github.com/pharmaR/risk_assessment).

**Current Focus**

In addition to working with the {riskmetric} team to better-support cohorts
of packages and multiple package versions, the team are building up metric and
package exploration features.  This includes links to source information such as
vignettes, and the ability to explore package documentation and tests.

**Key Skills Required**

Shiny app development experience is highly desirable; specifically, experience
with shiny modules and the {golem} package would be beneficial, but is not
required.

### Regulatory R Package Repository

The regulatory R package repository is currently working on minimal-viable
products for a number of key features. Progress is tracked on our 
[GitHub page](https://github.com/pharmaR/ regulatory-r-repo-wg), 
where you can find
[information for getting involved](https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg/issues/1).

## How else can I help?

If you have tried to implement any of the R Validation Hub's ideas, or used any
of our tools, or even if you've decided to go own way, then we would love you to
submit a case study describing what you have done to implement a GxP-compliant
R environment to our [Case Study](https://github.com/pharmaR/case_studies)
catalogue on GitHub.  Use our mailing list or GitHub issues to let us know
of your intentions and we'll work with you to upload your written case study.
We're also pleased to share case studies verbally with the wider community.  You
can find videos of previous presentations on our [case studies](/casestudies/)
page.

*If you still don't feel that you can contribute then please consider one of our
[partner initiatives](https://www.pharmar.org/partners/).*
