<h2>About the App</h2>
<p><img src="/img/risk/riskassessment_logo.png" width="130" /></p>
<p>The app’s <strong>main goal</strong> is to help those making “package inclusion” requests for validated GxP environments. So, the highest and best of <a href="https://bit.ly/raa_gh"><code>{riskassessment}</code></a> revolves around two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Empower members of your organization to embrace their responsibility to assess package risk themselves, prior to making uninformed IT requests like: “please add package xyz to our validated environment”.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish guide rails that adopt to your organizations validation strategy and use of <code>{riskmetric}</code> which culminates in a report for IT that summarizes each package’s adherence to those inclusion requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>{riskassessment}</code> app achieves that main goal with the following handy offerings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a platform for package exploration without the need to write any custom <code>{riskmetric}</code></li>
<li>Runs <code>{riskmetric}</code> on the same machine with the same environment – creating a central hub for reproducibility</li>
<li>Maintains consistent, org-specific settings/options when producing risk outputs</li>
<li>Automates a risk-based “decision triage” based on an org-defined set of rules, saving time &amp; effort</li>
<li>Manages who’s involved in the review process via user authentication &amp; role management</li>
<li>Facilitates and stores user written summaries &amp; communication, on certain packages and/or certain metrics</li>
<li>Generates risk summary reports, for sharing with the decision making parties</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a screenshot from the application’s current <a href="https://bit.ly/raa_demo">demo app</a>, hosted on shinyapps.io. Feel free to give it a test ride!</p>
