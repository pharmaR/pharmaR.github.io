The main challenge of using R in late-phase trials is ensuring validation documentation. In June 2018, the R-Consortium awarded funding to create an online repository for R package validation in accordance with regulatory standards.

We focus on designing a framework that assesses the quality of an R package.

## R Validation Hub: Mission 

R Validation Hub is a cross-industry initiative whose mission is to enable the use of R by the Bio-Pharmaceutical Industry in a regulatory setting, where the output may be used in submissions to regulatory agencies.

As of May 2019, the *R Validation Hub* is governed by an executive committee. 

* Andy Nicholls (Chair)
* Lyn Taylor (Secretary)
