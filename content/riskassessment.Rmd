## About the App

![](/img/risk/riskassessment_logo.png){width="130"}

The app's **main goal** is to help those making "package inclusion" requests for validated GxP environments. So, the highest and best of [`{riskassessment}`](https://bit.ly/raa_gh) revolves around two things:

-   Empower members of your organization to embrace their responsibility to assess package risk themselves, prior to making uninformed IT requests like: "please add package xyz to our validated environment".

-   Establish guide rails that adopt to your organizations validation strategy and use of `{riskmetric}` which culminates in a report for IT that summarizes each package's adherence to those inclusion requirements.

The `{riskassessment}` app achieves that main goal with the following handy offerings:

-   Provides a platform for package exploration without the need to write any custom `{riskmetric}`
-   Runs `{riskmetric}` on the same machine with the same environment -- creating a central hub for reproducibility
-   Maintains consistent, org-specific settings/options when producing risk outputs
-   Automates a risk-based "decision triage" based on an org-defined set of rules, saving time & effort
-   Manages who's involved in the review process via user authentication & role management
-   Facilitates and stores user written summaries & communication, on certain packages and/or certain metrics
-   Generates risk summary reports, for sharing with the decision making parties

Below is a screenshot from the application's current [demo app](https://bit.ly/raa_demo), hosted on shinyapps.io. Feel free to give it a test ride!
