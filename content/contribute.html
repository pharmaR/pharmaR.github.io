<h2>Contribute to a Working Group</h2>
<p>If you are willing and able to commit more time to the R Validation
Hub’s mission, then there are several options depending on your skills
and interests. If you do not feel you have the necessary technical
skills to contribute then please don’t let that stop you from getting in
touch and sharing ideas to support the implementation of a risk-based R
package assessment.</p>
<p>In each case you can get involved either by contacting the stream leads
via the relevant GitHub page, or by sending a message to us via the
contact form on our <a href="/contact/">Contact Us</a> page.</p>

<h3>The Communications Workstream</h3>
<p><em>Check back later!</em></p>
<p>The communications workstream is our newest endeavor. We’ve been
fortunate to have a lot of interest in these roles. Please check back
later to see if the team is looking to grow.</p>

<div id="the-riskmetric-r-package" class="section level3">
<h3>The <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric">{riskmetric}</a> R Package</h3>
<p>The {riskmetric} package collects metrics that support the idea of a
risk-based evaluation of R packages. The package collects and summarizes
various metrics and provides the means to quantify the risk of a package
via a weighted risk score. It also serves as the backbone of the Risk
Assessment Shiny application. For more information see the <a href="https://pharmar.github.io/%20riskmetric/">package
site</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric">GitHub
page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Current Focus</strong></p>
<p>The {riskmetric} team is currently looking to build features to support
the idea of package cohorts. We are also looking to refine some of the
meta-information collected by riskmetric to better serve the risk
assessment application. The team also has a <a href="https://%20github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric/issues">backlog of other open
issues</a>, including
additional metrics that they would like to explore.</p>
<p><strong>Key Skills Required</strong></p>
<p>A fundamental understanding of R packages is essential for anyone
looking to support the {riskmetric} team. Package development experience
is also highly beneficial.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-riskassessment-application" class="section level3">
<h3>The <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment">{riskassessment} Application</a></h3>
<p>The risk assessment Shiny app is an extension of the {riskmetric} R
package and provides a graphical interface to the {riskmetric}
functionality. It provides further exploratory capabilities in addition
to the numeric metrics and improves ease-of-use for organizations to
adopt a risk-based approach to R package validation. For more
information see the <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/risk_assessment">package GitHub
page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Current Focus</strong></p>
<p>In addition to working with the {riskmetric} team to better support
cohorts of packages and multiple package versions, the team is building
up metric and package exploration features. This includes links to
source information such as vignettes, and the ability to explore package
documentation and tests.</p>
<p><strong>Key Skills Required</strong></p>
<p>Shiny app development experience is highly desirable; specifically,
experience with Shiny modules and the {golem} package would be
beneficial but is not required.</p>

<div id="the-regulatory-r-package-repository" class="section level3">
<h3>The Regulatory R Package Repository</h3>
<p>The regulatory R package repository is currently working on
minimal-viable products for a number of key features. Progress is
tracked on our <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/%20regulatory-r-repo-wg">GitHub
page</a>, where you can
find <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/regulatory-r-repo-wg/issues/1">information for getting
involved</a>.</p>

<h2>How else can I help?</h2>
<p>If you have tried to implement any of the R Validation Hub’s ideas, or
used any of our tools, or even if you’ve decided to go own way, then we
would love you to submit a case study describing what you have done to
implement a GxP-compliant R environment to our <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/case_studies">Case
Study</a> catalogue on GitHub. Use
our mailing list or GitHub issues to let us know of your intentions and
we’ll work with you to upload your written case study. We’re also
pleased to share case studies verbally with the wider community. You can
find videos of previous presentations on our <a href="/casestudies/">case
studies</a> page.</p>
<p><em>If you still don’t feel that you can contribute then please consider
one of our <a href="https://www.pharmar.org/partners/">partner initiatives</a>.</em></p>
