I'm pleased to share that the R Validation Hub's efforts have been recognised in the ASA [Biopharmaceutical report, Fall 2022](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/AMSTAT/fa4dd52c-8429-41d0-abdf-0011047bfa19/UploadedImages/BIOP%20Report/BioPharm_fall2022FINAL.pdf).  Within the edition you can find our paper, Risk Assessment of R Packages: Learnings and Reflections.  This paper reflects on our white paper; provides an overview of our {[riskmetric](https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/)} package and [Risk Assessment](https://github.com/pharmaR/risk_assessment) application; and summarises our 2022 case studies (which you can now find on our [Case Studies](/casestudies/) page).
