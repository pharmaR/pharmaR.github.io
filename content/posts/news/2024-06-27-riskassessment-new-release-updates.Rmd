Welcome! It's with great excitement and long-awaited anticipation that I get to share some recent updates that have hit the `{riskassessment}` app's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment) earlier this month. If this is the first time you've heard or seen the application, I'd recommend starting with our [`README`](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment#readme) to gain some familiarity with the project, especially with installation instructions. However, (in a nut-shell) the app is a full-fledged R package that seeks augment the utility of the [`{riskmetric}`](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric) package within an organizational context.

## Latest features Recap

Since our last announcement for {riskassessment} version 2.0.0, there have been several releases (both major and minor). With that in mind, we will be highlighting changes and updates across both of those including the following:

* Expanded use cases for the decision automation rules
* New `'Function Explorer'` page and faster exploration of source code
* Expanded the package dependency view
* Miscellaneous items
  * `'About'` tab
  * non-`shinymanager` deployment

As always, we invite all who have suggestions or contributions to visit our Github repository. If you come across a bug or have a feature request, please visit our [open list of issues](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/issues) and add a comment or [open a new issue](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/issues/new) if it is a new bug/feature.

## Decision Automation Rules

Previously, the application would allow rules to be created based upon the overall risk score of the package. This feature is now expanded to include the `{riskmetric}` assessments. The process follows these basic steps:

1. Choose a `{riskmetric}` assessment you would like to base a rule on.
2. Construct a function taking the assessment value as an argument and returns a logical (`TRUE`/`FALSE`).
3. Choose the decision category to assign if the test returns `TRUE`.

When constructing rules, it is important to know the structure of the assessment. All `{riskmetric}` assessments can be found in the [assessment function catalog](https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/reference/pkg_assess.html#assessment-function-catalog) on their website. All helper functions from `{riskmetric}` are available for use when constructing the rules allowing a lot of flexibility in how the assessment can be parsed.

The rules can easily be re-ordered and will be read in a linear fashion. If no rules assigned a decision category to the package, the `ELSE` option can be used to assign a decision but defaults to "No Decision".

## New `'Function Explorer'` page

There has also been a major addition with a brand new page under the `'Source Explorer'` tab. This extends the value of the application to organizations with a more manual review process and the ability for app users to explore packages on a more granular level. While previously a user could browse all the source code, now they can easily browse the functions exported for use from the package.

Below, you will see a panel on the left containing selection inputs and a viewer pane on the right. Simply choose a function you want to further explore and what type of files. The type of files include the following: Testing Files, R Source Code, Help Documentation.

1. Testing Files: All discovered test files in the `tests/` folder containing the function will be displayed.
2. R Source Code: All R files in the `R/` folder containing the function will be displayed. This includes all usages of the function, not just where it was defined.
3. Help Documentation: The Rd file containing the function will be displayed.

Some additional features:

* If multiple lines containing the function are found, a navigation will appear below the viewer pane allowing the user to quickly jump to each instance.
* Commenting is available for both the Function Explorer and the Package Browser.
* The `{archive}` package is being used to read these files into memory which greatly increases the speed for the `'Source Explorer'` tab.

## Expanded Dependency Exploration

Cards are now included providing a macroscopic view of the dependencies!

* Dependencies Uploaded: the number of package dependencies that have been uploaded to the app
* Type Summary: a breakdown of the dependency types (Depends, Imports, and LinkingTo)
* Decision summary: a breakdown of the decisions applied to the dependencies
* Base-R packages: a summary of which dependencies are considered part of base R (i.e. utils, stats, methods, etc.)

Optionally the 'Suggests' can also be included to give a more holistic view of a package's dependency structure.

A reverse dependency table has also been included. This table is populated with the reverse dependency packages that have been uploaded to the app. Now in the event that a package is being re-assessed/re-evaluated, a user can quickly look at the downstream packages effected by a change in classification.

## Miscellaneous Items

### Expanded `'About'` Tab

* Contact: report issues, reach out to contribute, learn more about the R Validation Hub
* Contributors and Companies: get to know contributors, past and present

### Non-`shinymanager` Deployment
If deploying the application to an environment like POSIT Connect, the usage of `shinymanager` can be turned off. The user will then be assigned by `session$user` and the role by `session$groups`. This will allow organizations to manage application privileges using the roles assigned to the user on Connect.

## In Closing

Thank you for checking out our newest release. We hope you are as excited about the development as we are.
