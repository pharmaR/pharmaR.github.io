<p>At a recent <strong><em>ShinyGatherings</em></strong>, some <code>{riskassessment}</code> contributors presented a workshop that focused on tailoring the application to org-specific risk requirements to simplify R package validation. Though we discussed the end-user experience, this workshop was really geared towards equipping “app deployers” to get the highest and best use out of the application for their organization’s specific needs. We appreciate <a href="https://www.appsilon.com/">Appsilon</a> for the opportunity to speak about the application!</p>

<h3>About the Workshop</h3>
<p><strong>The workshop’s main topics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A brief recap on what the <code>{riskassessment}</code> app does. <em>Spoiler alert: it’s goal is to simplify the risk assessment process with a structured and user-friendly approach that avoids the need to author custom R code.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Why (and when) organizations should use the app with an emphasis on how it can alleviate the burden of making informed decisions about packages</p></li>
<li><p>How the app guides end-users to follow org-specific workflows, whether that be logging, reviewing package metrics, verifying the risk of dependencies, and justifying GxP package inclusion requests using comprehensive downloadable reports.</p></li>
<li><p>How “app deployers” can set custom org-specific rules to automate package risk assessment using the desired risk metric criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>A thorough look at the app’s role-based access control and how it plays well with Posit Connect authenticated users.</p></li>
<li><p>Common challenges &amp; caveats we recognize related to the app</p></li>
</ul>
