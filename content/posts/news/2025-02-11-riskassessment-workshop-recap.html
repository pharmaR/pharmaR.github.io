<p>At a recent <strong><em>ShinyGatherings</em></strong>, we held a workshop for the <code>{riskassessment}</code> application, focusing on how we can simplify R package validation with a user-friendly approach that can be tailored to your specific risk assessment requirements. We appreciate Appsilon for the opportunity to speak about our app!</p>
