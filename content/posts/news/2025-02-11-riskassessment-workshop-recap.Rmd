At a recent ***ShinyGatherings***, we held a workshop for the `{riskassessment}` application, focusing on how we can simplify R package validation with a user-friendly approach that can be tailored to your specific risk assessment requirements. We appreciate Appsilon for the opportunity to speak about our app!
