At a recent ***ShinyGatherings***, some `{riskassessment}` contributors presented a workshop that focused on tailoring the application to org-specific risk requirements to simplify R package validation. Though we discussed the end-user experience, this workshop was really geared towards equipping "app deployers" to get the highest and best use out of the application for their organization's specific needs. We appreciate [Appsilon](https://www.appsilon.com/) for the opportunity to speak about the application!

### About the Workshop

**The workshop's main topics:**

-   Why you should use the app and how it assists with making informed decisions about packages

-   How the app guides end-user workflows, from logging into the app, to reviewing package metrics and checking dependencies, to justifying package requests and submitting the request

-   How to customize the app with custom risk assessment rules, decision automation, role-based access control, and storage of organization-specific settings

-   Why the app stands out in 7 big ways, namely its automated package assessments, comprehensive risk summary reports, and more
