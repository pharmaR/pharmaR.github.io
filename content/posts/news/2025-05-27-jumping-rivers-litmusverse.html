<p>Since 2018, the R Validation Hub has devoted considerable time and energy to the development of powerful R packages that are designed to support the risk assessment of R packages. Our commitment to building a comprehensive validation framework—alongside tools like <code>{riskmetric}</code> and <code>{riskassessment}</code>—has proven to be a sound investment. This is reflected in the ongoing support of the R Consortium of our working group, the inclusion of our packages in the Pharmaverse, and the growing prominence of our framework and tools at the heart of the expanding risk assessment landscape. <br></p>

<h3>Debut of the Litmusverse</h3>
<p>This spring, <strong>Jumping Rivers</strong> unveiled their suite of packages, the <a href="https://www.jumpingrivers.com/litmus/"><strong><em>litmusverse</em></strong></a>, which is designed to simplify and streamline the complex, nuanced process of package validation. The litmusverse builds on top of <code>{riskmetric}</code> to pull package metadata and generate quality scores on such data, furthering the value of our efforts in other groups’ applications. The package suite also includes packages for exploring package results and generating reports—both with an exceptional level of polish. We are happy to see that the validation principles outlined in our white paper have also played a role in shaping their efforts. As highlighted in <a href="https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/should-i-use-your-r-pkg/">their blog post, “Should I Use Your R Package?”</a>, the litmusverse has positioned our work as a key influence, “paving the way” for the biopharmaceutical industry’s evolving validation needs. We were happy to be in close communication with Jumping Rivers during their development and appreciate that an open-source ecosystem fosters a means to unify development efforts and continue creating more and better solutions.</p>

<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>As our tools gain recognition and influence within the wider R community, we remain focused on <strong>our mission: supporting R adoption across industries while championing the open-source and collaborative spirit of the R ecosystem</strong>. While new players emerge in the risk assessment space, our dedication to evolving and refining our offerings endures. We will continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in package validation by advancing our tools toward <strong>more robust decision-making, broader use cases, industry-agnostic solutions, a public repository, and much more.</strong></p>
