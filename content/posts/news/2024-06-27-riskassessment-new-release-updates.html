<p>Welcome! It’s with great excitement and long-awaited anticipation that I get to share some recent updates that have hit the <code>{riskassessment}</code> app’s <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment">GitHub repository</a> earlier this month. If this is the first time you’ve heard or seen the application, I’d recommend starting with our <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment#readme"><code>README</code></a> to gain some familiarity with the project, especially with installation instructions. However, (in a nut-shell) the app is a full-fledged R package that seeks augment the utility of the <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric"><code>{riskmetric}</code></a> package within an organizational context.</p>

<h2 id="latest-features-recap">Latest features Recap</h2>
<p>Since our last announcement for {riskassessment} version 2.0.0, there have been several releases (both major and minor). With that in mind, we will be highlighting changes and updates across both of those including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanded use cases for the decision automation rules</li>
<li>New <code>'Function Explorer'</code> page and faster exploration of source code</li>
<li>Expanded the package dependency view</li>
<li>Miscellaneous items
<ul>
<li><code>'About'</code> tab</li>
<li>non-<code>shinymanager</code> deployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, we invite all who have suggestions or contributions to visit our Github repository. If you come across a bug or have a feature request, please visit our <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/issues">open list of issues</a> and add a comment or <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/issues/new">open a new issue</a> if it is a new bug/feature.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="decision-automation-rules">Decision Automation Rules</h2>
<p>Previously, the application would allow rules to be created based upon the overall risk score of the package. This feature is now expanded to include the <code>{riskmetric}</code> assessments. The process follows these basic steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a <code>{riskmetric}</code> assessment you would like to base a rule on.</li>
<li>Construct a function taking the assessment value as an argument and returns a logical (<code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code>).</li>
<li>Choose the decision category to assign if the test returns <code>TRUE</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When constructing rules, it is important to know the structure of the assessment. All <code>{riskmetric}</code> assessments can be found in the <a href="https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/reference/pkg_assess.html#assessment-function-catalog">assessment function catalog</a> on their website. All helper functions from <code>{riskmetric}</code> are available for use when constructing the rules allowing a lot of flexibility in how the assessment can be parsed.</p>
<p>The rules can easily be re-ordered and will be read in a linear fashion. If no rules assigned a decision category to the package, the <code>ELSE</code> option can be used to assign a decision but defaults to “No Decision”.</p>
<h2 id="new-function-explorer-page">New <code>'Function Explorer'</code> page</h2>
<p>There has also been a major addition with a brand new page under the <code>'Source Explorer'</code> tab. This extends the value of the application to organizations with a more manual review process and the ability for app users to explore packages on a more granular level. While previously a user could browse all the source code, now they can easily browse the functions exported for use from the package.</p>
<p>Below, you will see a panel on the left containing selection inputs and a viewer pane on the right. Simply choose a function you want to further explore and what type of files. The type of files include the following: Testing Files, R Source Code, Help Documentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Testing Files: All discovered test files in the <code>tests/</code> folder containing the function will be displayed.</li>
<li>R Source Code: All R files in the <code>R/</code> folder containing the function will be displayed. This includes all usages of the function, not just where it was defined.</li>
<li>Help Documentation: The Rd file containing the function will be displayed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some additional features:</p>
<ul>
<li>If multiple lines containing the function are found, a navigation will appear below the viewer pane allowing the user to quickly jump to each instance.</li>
<li>Commenting is available for both the Function Explorer and the Package Browser.</li>
<li>The <code>{archive}</code> package is being used to read these files into memory which greatly increases the speed for the <code>'Source Explorer'</code> tab.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="expanded-dependency-exploration">Expanded Dependency Exploration</h2>
<p>Cards are now included providing a macroscopic view of the dependencies!</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependencies Uploaded: the number of package dependencies that have been uploaded to the app</li>
<li>Type Summary: a breakdown of the dependency types (Depends, Imports, and LinkingTo)</li>
<li>Decision summary: a breakdown of the decisions applied to the dependencies</li>
<li>Base-R packages: a summary of which dependencies are considered part of base R (i.e. utils, stats, methods, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally the ‘Suggests’ can also be included to give a more holistic view of a package’s dependency structure.</p>
<p>A reverse dependency table has also been included. This table is populated with the reverse dependency packages that have been uploaded to the app. Now in the event that a package is being re-assessed/re-evaluated, a user can quickly look at the downstream packages effected by a change in classification.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-items">Miscellaneous Items</h2>
<h3 id="expanded-about-tab">Expanded <code>'About'</code> Tab</h3>
<ul>
<li>Contact: report issues, reach out to contribute, learn more about the R Validation Hub</li>
<li>Contributors and Companies: get to know contributors, past and present</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-shinymanager-deployment">Non-<code>shinymanager</code> Deployment</h3>
<p>If deploying the application to an environment like POSIT Connect, the usage of <code>shinymanager</code> can be turned off. The user will then be assigned by <code>session$user</code> and the role by <code>session$groups</code>. This will allow organizations to manage application privileges using the roles assigned to the user on Connect.</p>
<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing</h2>
