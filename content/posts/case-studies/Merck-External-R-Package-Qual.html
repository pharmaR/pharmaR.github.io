<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>There has been a growing interest in pharmaceutical industry to use R for clinical trial data analysis and reporting (A&amp;R). Using R for regulatory submission purposes requires careful qualification of R packages given that the open-source packages differ in their quality of development. Many cross-industry initiatives including R Validation Hub and TransCelerate have published framework for qualifying R packages to be used in a regulatory setting (Nicholls, Bargo, &amp; Sims, 2020) (Amoruccio, Lee, &amp; Woodie, 2021). Our organization has been exploring the use of R in a regulatory setting for the past few years. A framework has been developed internally for qualifying external R packages that incorporates elements from both R Validation Hub and TransCelerate framework. This framework is currently being used to qualify both internally developed and externally sourced R packages for use in clinical trial A&amp;R. In this document, we demonstrate this risk-based package qualification framework using the GGally R package. We provide the workflow as well as relevant details regarding the package qualification process used to qualify GGally as a moderate risk R package. We hope this inspires other organizations to use R in a regulatory setting as well as generate discussion to improve our existing framework.</p>
<p><strong>Risk-Based Package Qualification Framework</strong></p>
<p>The R package qualification framework deployed at Merck is based on validation as defined by FDA (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing c/o Institute for Statistics and Mathematics, 2021). The goal of the framework is to create documentation that contains qualification details of R package based on pre-specified criteria. The framework employs a risk-based strategy to qualify R packages based on the type of A&amp;R deliverable being generated. The types of deliverables and their associated R package risk levels are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>Table 1. Examples of deliverables and respective risk categories of the R packages</p>
<p>The pre-specified criteria used to qualify a R package into the desired risk category are defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>c1: Package is developed and maintained by a trusted vendor.</p></li>
<li><p>c2: Package is user-facing with sufficient software development lifecycle (SDLC) evidence equivalent to internal SDLC requirement.</p></li>
<li><p>c3: Package is not user-facing and all packages dependent on this R package are qualified.</p></li>
<li><p>c4: Package is user-facing with additional internal work to complete necessary steps following internal SDLC requirement.</p></li>
<li><p>c5: Package maintained by a trusted person or organization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An R package can be qualified under low risk category if it meets any of the first four criteria i.e., c1-c4. For moderate risk category the R package needs to meet any of the five criteria i.e., c1- c5. Any R package used for exploratory purposes and not qualified under either low-risk or moderate-risk category is categorized as open-risk. Any other R package deployed by users from external sources such as Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or other repositories is automatically categorized as open risk.</p>
<p><strong>R Package Qualification Workflow</strong></p>
<p>Within our organization a shared baseline strategy recommended by RStudio is followed to manage a reproducible R environment (RStudio, 2020). The defining characteristic of shared baseline strategy is that R package availability is tied to R installations using site-wide libraries. The use of scheduled updates to the site-wide libraries allows all users to use the same installed packages, thereby creating a baseline environment to share and re-run work. An R package within our organization is available through a regularly updated site-wide library installation called Global R library. The global R library is a set of directories containing installed R packages and their dependencies. There are 3 risk levels within the global R library corresponding to the risk category used in package qualification. The global R library is nested and independent, with all low-risk packages included in the moderate-risk library, and all moderate-risk packages included in the open-risk library. Our organization employs RStudio Package Manager (RSPM) as the R package repository server to host source code to install the packages in global R library. A high-level global R library update and package qualification workflow is summarized below (Figure 1).</p>

<p><strong>GGally Package Qualification</strong></p>
<p>GGally is an R package that extends ggplot2 R package functionality by adding several functions to reduce the complexity of combining geometric objects (geoms) with transformed data (Schloerke, 2020). Based on a request to use the GGally package in a publication, the package was qualified under moderate risk category. The steps in the qualification process followed were:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Review package documentation to determine qualifying criteria. It was determined that this package can be qualified using the c2 and c5 criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform a dry-run installation for global R library update, with GGally set as moderate risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Check installation log for errors / warning messages (Figure 2):</p></li>

<p><u>Package Qualification – “GGally”</u></p>
<p>Qualification Overview</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that GGally, when used in a qualified fashion, can support the appropriate regulatory requirements for validated systems, thus ensuring that resulting electronic records are “trustworthy, reliable and generally equivalent to paper records.”</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>A risk-based R package qualification process has been deployed at Merck to classify R packages based on generated A&amp;R deliverables. This process has been automated using internally developed R package to both streamline the process as well as reduce any human errors. The qualification of GGally R package under moderate risk category using the qualification process, demonstrates the useability of the qualification framework for qualifying R packages in a regulatory setting. There is ongoing work to enhance the internally developed R package used in package qualification framework to further automate the process. We are also working on defining the pre-specified criteria used to qualify an organization or group of vendors as trusted source, thereby reducing the burden of qualifying individual packages.</p>
