<p>This case study walks through the automated R package validation process at Roche that utilizes a human-in-the-middle component to reconcile any gaps that arise in the automated metadata checks. The approach balances automation with risk mitigation and encourages in-house package development and iteration by introducing transparency to the validation process. The result reinforces best practices in R programming and package development while ensuring high package quality for use within a regulatory environment.</p>
