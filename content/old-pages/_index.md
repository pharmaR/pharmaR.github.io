# Purpose
The R-Consortium in June 2018 awarded funding to create an online repository for R package validation in accordance with regulatory standards. Since the main hurdle for widespread use of R in late phase trials is ensuring adequate validation documentation, we are now focused on designing a framework which will specify a set of requirements, including metadata and examples of tests, which together would form evidence of the quality of an R package.   

Initially we will use dplyr as an example, and will make this “evidence of validation” available to the wider community on GitHub. Whether the evidence provided is sufficient will be the decision of the end user, but it can be a starting point for further testing or may be sufficient in itself depending on the user’s attitude to risk. After review by our peers and with agreement that the framework is sufficient for use in the regulatory environment, we will be calling on all R users to submit similar evidence of validation for other packages. 

By sharing this evidence, we hope to reduce the amount of re-work being done by multiple companies eager to use R, but fearful of doing so in a regulatory environment without documentation of validation.
