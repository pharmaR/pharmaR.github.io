<p>Welcome! It’s with great excitement and long-awaited anticipation
that I get to share some recent updates that have hit the
<code>{riskassessment}</code> app’s <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment">GitHub repository</a>
earlier this month. If this is the first time you’ve heard or seen the
application, I’d recommend starting with our <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment#readme"><code>README</code></a>
to gain some familiarity with the project, especially with installation
instructions. However, (in a nut-shell) the app is a full-fledged R
package that seeks augment the utility of the <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskmetric"><code>{riskmetric}</code></a>
package within an organizational context.</p>

<h2>Latest features Recap</h2>
<p>Most notably, the application has sustained the following
improvements, in order from least exciting to most exciting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Face lift to functionality &amp; aesthetics of the
<code>&#39;Report Builder&#39;</code> &amp; <code>&#39;Database View&#39;</code></li>
<li>Enhanced support to analyze dependencies</li>
<li>More org-level customization, including the use of a configuration
file</li>
<li><code>admin</code>s can now to edit roles and privileges</li>
<li>All users can explore source contents of package</li>
</ul>
<p>The feedback loop is crucial! All of these improvements started off
as community-driven suggestions on our GitHub repo. If you have an idea
that doesn’t already exist on the <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/issues">existing
list</a> of issues, <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/issues/new">submit a new
issue</a> today and it may become a reality tomorrow.</p>

<div id="report-builder-face-lift" class="section level2">
<h2><code>&#39;Report Builder&#39;</code> Face Lift</h2>
<p>This new release introducted a more holistic Report Builder! Allowing
users to define what content shows up in the report. In addition, users
can now compose a long form “Package Summary” to keep track of more
pertinent items (perhaps non-<code>{riskmetric}</code> items) for a more
rounded package review.</p>
<p>In the example below, see how users can quickly include/exclude
specific elements in the summary report, plus edit the package summary
in a real-time report preview. When satisfied, the user can download the
report to HTML, DOCX, or PDF:</p>

<h2><code>&#39;Database View&#39;</code> Face Lift</h2>
<p>More useful content to ingest!</p>
<ul>
<li>A summary of uploaded packages</li>
<li>The package uploaded date</li>
<li>Decision-related columns including a time stamp &amp; decision
source</li>
<li>Quick &amp; easy download options to Excel or CSV</li>
</ul>

<div id="package-dependencies" class="section level2">
<h2>Package Dependencies</h2>
<p>Though <code>{riskmetric}</code> has supported the dependencies
assessment for some time, the application didn’t do a great job of
displaying this data until this release. Now, the user can see each
package dependency which may or may not have a lower bound on it, plus
the dependency type (Imports, Depends, LinkingTo, or Suggests). If the
package dependency already exists in the <code>{riskassessment}</code>
database, then it’s risk score is displayed. When the package hasn’t
been uploaded yet, there are convenient buttons to help the user
evaluate those packages.</p>

<div id="enhanced-organization-level-settings" class="section level2">
<h2>Enhanced organization-level settings</h2>
<p>The following features allow <code>admin</code>s critical control
over how prospective users within an organization perform their risk
assessments. Most, if not all, can be edited in-app or via the config
file! So, what’s new? You can now…</p>
<ul>
<li>Add/edit user roles/privileges</li>
<li>Customize decision categories &amp; colors</li>
<li>Toggle decision automation rules</li>
<li>Initialize metric weights</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example configuration file that demonstrates our ability
to togggle these settings. First, config athors can add as many roles as
they want under <code>credentials</code>. From there, they can use the
<code>privileges</code> tag to populate that role with unique privileges
in the app. For a details on each privilege, please see our <a href="https://pharmar.github.io/riskassessment/articles/User_Roles_and_Privileges.html#privileges">documentation
site</a>. These roles can then be assigned to specific users to manage
who is involved with different parts of the review process.</p>
<p>Next, <code>decisions</code> is where users can define custom package
categories in the application that correspond to their organization’s
validation process. From there, you can automate decisions based on risk
scores or even define a custom color to each decision category.</p>
<p>By default, all metric weights (that ultimately determine package
risk scores) are set to 1, unless you override them here or in the app’s
UI. This is a convenient way to incorporate your organizations
priorities into the validation process for all users of the application.
Use a zero (0) to remove a metric entirely.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Example config (YML) file:</p>
<pre class="yml"><code>default:
  assessment_db: database.sqlite
  loggit_json: loggit.json
  credential_db: credentials.sqlite
  credentials:
    roles:
      - admin
      - lead
      - reviewer
      - viewer
    privileges:
      admin: [admin, weight_adjust, auto_decision_adjust, final_decision, revert_decision, add_package, delete_package, overall_comment, general_comment]
      lead: [weight_adjust, auto_decision_adjust, final_decision, revert_decision, add_package, delete_package, overall_comment, general_comment]
      reviewer: [add_package, general_comment]
      viewer:
  decisions:
    categories:
      - Low Risk
      - Medium Risk
      - High Risk
    rules:
      Medium Risk:
        - .398
        - .639
      High Risk:
        - .639
        - 1
    colors:
      Medium Risk: !expr grDevices::rgb(52, 235, 229, maxColorValue = 255)
  metric_weights:
    covr_coverage: 2
    has_vignettes: 0</code></pre>

<div id="edit-roles-privileges" class="section level2">
<h2>Edit Roles &amp; Privileges</h2>
<p>Building on the configuration file, <code>admin</code> users can also
manage who’s involved in the review process on the fly in the app. This
is helpful so that the application doesn’t have to be re-deployed every
time a new role needs creation. User authentication &amp; role
management is a major cornerstone of this application, which helps
organizations adhere to their unique validation strategies.</p>

<div id="explore-package-source-code" class="section level2">
<h2>Explore Package Source Code</h2>
<p>Finally, if there were one major change to announce at this release
that creates unique value for app users, it would be this: the app now
offers the ability to browse package source code! This is huge news for
those orgs with a more manual package review process.
<code>{riskmetric}</code> metrics are great because they can serve up
isolated assessments from the source code (and beyond), but sometimes
you just need to dig deeper into a package’s contents, and that’s what
his new module does.</p>
<p>Below, you can see the ‘FILE BROWSER’ which gives us a directory tree
on the left hand side and a file preview on the right. Currently, it’s
displaying a description file for the <code>{tidyCDISC}</code> package.
There you can explore all the things you may care about, such as the
license, maintainer, dependencies, etc. In addition, you can navigate to
a specific function’s script in the <code>R/</code> folder to review
methodology. Even more importantly, you can browse through the author’s
tests to evaluate testing coverage and robustness.</p>
