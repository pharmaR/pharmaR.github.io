<p>We have reached a major milestone. The R package <a href="https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/"><code>riskmetric</code></a> has been released and is now available on CRAN.</p>
<div id="what-is-riskmetric" class="section level3">
<h3>What is riskmetric?</h3>
<p><code>riskmetric</code> is a collection of risk metrics to evaluate the quality of R packages following the framework suggested by the R validation hub (see our <a href="https://www.pharmar.org/white-paper/">white paper</a> for details).
Various quality metrics are provided which evaluate best practices of software development, code documentation, community engagement and development sustainability. This package serves as a starting point for exploring the heterogeneity of code quality, and begin a broader conversation about the validation of R packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-use-it" class="section level3">
<h3>How to use it?</h3>
<p>We separate three steps in the workflow to assess the risk of an R package using riskmetric:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Finding a source for package information (installed package or CRAN/git source) <code>pkg_ref()</code></li>
<li>Assessing the package under validation criteria <code>pkg_assess()</code></li>
<li>Scoring assessment criteria <code>pkg_score()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The results will be assembled in a dataset of validation criteria containing an overall risk score for each package</p>
<p>A detailed demo can be found in this <a href="https://www.pharmar.org/blog/2020/06/09/2020-06-02-riskmetric-intro-jun-2020/">blogpost</a> from last year.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-comes-next" class="section level3">
<h3>What comes next?</h3>
<p>The development of riskmetric continues and it is a community project. Comfort with a quantification of risk comes via consensus, and for that this project is dependent on close community engagement. There are plenty of ways to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the package</li>
<li>File issues when you encounter bugs</li>
<li>Weigh in on proposed metrics, or suggest a new one</li>
<li>Help us devise the best way to summarize risk into a single score</li>
<li>Help us keep documentation up to date</li>
<li>Contribute code to tackle the metric backlog</li>
</ul>
