**This is a re-post.  The original post from the R Consortium can be found [here](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2022/02/03/risk-assessment-shiny-app-update-from-r-validation-hub)**

Recent update by Marly Cormar on the Risk Assessment Shiny App. Marly is an executive committee member of the R Validation Hub where she advocates for the use of R within a biopharmaceutical regulatory setting, and Senior Data Scientist at Biogen.

The Risk Assessment App is an interactive web application serving as a front end application for the riskmetric R package. riskmetric is a framework to quantify risk by assessing a number of metrics meant to evaluate development best practices, code documentation, community engagement, and development sustainability. The app and riskmetric aim to provide some context for validation within regulated industries.


Update details:

- Planning to do a [beta release](https://github.com/pharmaR/risk_assessment/pull/162) by the end of February
- Video includes “sneak peak” walk through
